Holofied is a simple CM11 theme that replaces some subtle interface changes made by rom developers with the original AOSP assets.

###Items Themed:
* SystemUI (Wifi indicator, Mobile Data indicator, ADB icon)
* Boot Animation
* Wallpaper

###Changelog
* **1.4** : Hide mobile data indicators
* **1.3.1** : Added xxhdpi resources
* **1.3** : Added Stock 4.4 Wallpaper
* **1.2** : Changed debugging icon to stock kitkat
* **1.1** : Added Stock 4.4 boot animation
* **1.0** : Initial Commit

This theme requires the new CM11 theme engine and is not backwards compatible with the old one.
