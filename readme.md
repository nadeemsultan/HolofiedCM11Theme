#Simple CM11 Theme

Starting with android 4.4, Google removed the wifi network activity indicators in order for a more clean look. However, roms like Cyanogenmod have added it back.

All this theme does is replace those .png files with completely transparent ones, which hides the indicators and prevents the hassle of having to decompile and edit systemui everytime a nightly is flashed.

This theme requires the new CM11 theme engine and is not backwards compatible with the old one.
